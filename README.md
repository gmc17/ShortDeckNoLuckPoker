# ShortDeckNoLuckPoker

An implementation of Average Sampling Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (AS-MCCFR) for shortdeck Poker.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes the AS-MCCFR algorithm to compute game theory optimal (GTO) strategies for shortdeck Heads-up Poker.

## Building the Project
To build the project, use the provided Makefile:
make run

## Running the Program

After building, run the main executable:
./main

## Results

(in progress)
