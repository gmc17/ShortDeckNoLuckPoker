# ShortDeckNoLuckPoker

An implementation of Average Sampling Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (AS-MCCFR) for short deck texas hold-em.

## Introduction

This project utilizes the AS-MCCFR algorithm to compute game theory optimal (GTO) strategies for shortdeck Heads-up Poker.

## Running the Program

Currently, only terminal usage is supported. Run 'make run' to play against the computer.
